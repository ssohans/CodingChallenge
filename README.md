## Coding Challenge Description 

Here is an old phone keypad with alphabetical letters, a
backspace key, and a send

button.

Each button has a number to identify it and pressing a button
multiple times will

cycle through the letters on it allowing

each button to represent more than one letter.

For example, pressing 2 once will return ‘A’ but pressing twice
in succession will return
‘B’.

You must pause for a second in order to type two characters from the same
button

after each other: “222 2 22” -> “CAB”.
